# ParkingLots
Application to tackle parking problems

## Basic idea
In a company, an employee  can be aware of the remaining car/bike parking slots before entering the company premises to avoid unncessary hassles.

## Workflows
- Company administrator :- 
  1. Can input the number of slots to be allocated(for each vehicle types) in the parking lot to the employees.
  2. Can decide on the number of reserved parking slots for senior employees.
  3. Can capture the number of parking slots reserved for specially abled people.
  4. Can have the employee contact info and vehicle info in the system, in case they need to be contacted in case of wrong parking.
  5. Can check, if an employee has parked his vehicle in the reserved block even though it wasn't reserved in his name.
  6. Can get notifications when all the slots are full.

- An employee can :-
  1. Check if there are any parking blocks remaining when he is about to enter the company premises, so that he can take an action accordingly.
  2. IoT device in his car pairs up with the parking slot device and updates the system that the parking slot is occupied.(Future)
  3. The notification/warning to the employee in case he parks in any reserved parking slot.
  
## Iterations
 - In phase I, we would work only on the CRUD part(mobile app), the user has to manually enter the block number he is occupying.
 - In phase II, we would make use of the IoT devices to update the system without any manual intervention.
